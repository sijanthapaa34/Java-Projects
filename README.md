# Java-Projects
I made this project in my free time for practicing and improving my java skills, OOP concepts, error handling, SQL knowledge and ORM (hibernate). It was just for practice so it is simple yet reflects my core java skills.
This is a simple user management system for a bank.
I have used 11 classes, 2 enums for bank account type and bank transaction type and 1 functional Interface for calculating interest. To make the interest calculation more efficient, I used multithreading, enabling the system to calculate interest on balances concurrently, according to different bank accounts types.  This project has good error handling with try-catch blocks, throw and my own custom exception handling preventing unexpected failures. I used Hibernate for efficient ORM mapping to manage database interactions, and MySQL as the database for storing and retrieving data.
