# Java-Projects
This Bank Management System is a Java-based project developed using Core Java and Hibernate (ORM tool). It consists of 11 classes, 2 enums, and 1 functional interface, structured to efficiently handle various banking operations. The system directly interacts with a database, allowing seamless data manipulation both within the application and at the database level. It incorporates advanced Java concepts such as multithreading to calculate the interest per month according to bank account type.

To maintain system reliability and robustness, comprehensive error handling mechanisms have been implemented. The project uses custom exceptions to handle banking-specific errors like insufficient balance, invalid transactions, and unauthorized access. Additionally, try-catch blocks are strategically placed to manage common exceptions such as SQLExceptions, NullPointerExceptions, and RuntimeExceptions, preventing unexpected crashes. A logging mechanism is integrated to track errors and system activities, facilitating easier debugging and maintenance.
